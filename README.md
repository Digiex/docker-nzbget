# [digiex/nzbget](https://github.com/digiex/docker-nzbget)

[Nzbget](http://nzbget.net/) is a usenet downloader, written in C++ and designed with performance in mind to achieve maximum download speed by using very little system resources.

## Supported Architectures

Our images support multiple architectures such as `x86-64`, `arm64` and `armhf`. We utilise the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. More information is available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list)

Simply pulling `digiex/nzbget` should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| Architecture | Tag |
| :----: | --- |
| x86-64 | amd64-latest |
| arm64 | arm64v8-latest |
| armhf | arm32v7-latest |

## Version Tags

This image provides various versions that are available via tags. `latest` tag usually provides the latest stable version. Others are considered under development and caution must be exercised when using them.

| Tag | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| latest | Stable nzbget releases |
| testing | nzbget pre-releases |

## Usage

Here are some example snippets to help you get started creating a container.

### docker

```
docker create \
  --name=nzbget \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -p 6789:6789 \
  -v <path to data>:/config \
  -v <path/to/downloads>:/downloads \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  digiex/nzbget
```


### docker-compose

Compatible with docker-compose v2 schemas.

```
---
version: "2.1"
services:
  nzbget:
    image: digiex/nzbget
    container_name: nzbget
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
    volumes:
      - <path to data>:/config
      - <path/to/downloads>:/downloads
    ports:
      - 6789:6789
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 6789` | WebUI |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London. |
| `-v /config` | NZBGet App data. |
| `-v /downloads` | Location of downloads on disk. |

## Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`.

As an example:

```
-e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword
```

Will set the environment variable `PASSWORD` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretpassword` file.

# User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```

## Application Setup

Webui can be found at  `<your-ip>:6789` and the default login details (change ASAP) are

`login:nzbget, password:tegbzn6789`

To allow scheduling, from the webui set the time correction value in settings/logging.

To change umask settings.

scroll to bottom, set umask like this (example shown for unraid)

You can add an additional mount point for intermediate unpacking folder with:

`-v </path/to/intermedia_unpacking_folder>:/intermediate`

for example, and changing the setting for InterDir in the PATHS tab of settings to `/intermediate`

## Python 3 transition

We provide Python and related packages in this image for extension support. While extensions transition to Python 3 we will install both Python 2 and Python 3 in the standard container. If you want to force your extensions to use Python 3 you should modify:

`Settings => Extension Scripts => ShellOverride = .py=/usr/bin/python3`

## Updating Info

Below are the instructions for updating containers:

### Via Docker Run/Create
* Update the image: `docker pull digiex/nzbget`
* Stop the running container: `docker stop nzbget`
* Delete the container: `docker rm nzbget`
* Recreate a new container with the same docker create parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your `/config` folder and settings will be preserved)
* Start the new container: `docker start nzbget`
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Docker Compose
* Update all images: `docker-compose pull`
  * or update a single image: `docker-compose pull nzbget`
* Let compose update all containers as necessary: `docker-compose up -d`
  * or update a single container: `docker-compose up -d nzbget`
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Watchtower auto-updater (especially useful if you don't remember the original parameters)
* Pull the latest image at its tag and replace it with the same env variables in one run:
  ```
  docker run --rm \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  containrrr/watchtower \
  --run-once nzbget
  ```

**Note:** We do not endorse the use of Watchtower as a solution to automated updates of existing Docker containers. In fact we generally discourage automated updates. However, this is a useful tool for one-time manual updates of containers where you have forgotten the original parameters. In the long term, we highly recommend using Docker Compose.

* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

## Building locally

If you want to make local modifications to these images for development purposes or just to customize the logic:
```
git clone https://github.com/digiex/docker-nzbget.git
cd docker-nzbget
docker build \
  --no-cache \
  --pull \
  -t digiex/nzbget:latest .
```
